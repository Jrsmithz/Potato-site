#### First Project

##### The Potato Project
This will officially mark the start of uploading my first project officially to GITHUB. It's a cool little CSS Practice Project for myself, mostly to play around with HTML and CSS, going to really utilize branches in GIT to mess around, and see what we learn. Going to keep a running update on this project and make it a habit, including all my mistakes.

###### Project Update

Also had an update to the project.

+ Add the product tiers (Small, Medium, Large)
+ Add the features to each tier.
+ Add the panels using Grid.
+ Add light animation to the hover of the product tier.
+ Mostly a style add focused strictly on the Different shapes page.
